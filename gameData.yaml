          Things to discuss:
          - What attracted you to Enspiral?
          - What is your intention coming in? What would success look like to you?
          - What do you think you might like to contribute? What skills are you bringing?
          Based on these questions, they will think of three people for you to connect with (either through Slack or email)

We don’t suggest you consume all of these in your first week (unless you’re really keen!). The ones with an asterisk* on them are the most important reads to get you started."
