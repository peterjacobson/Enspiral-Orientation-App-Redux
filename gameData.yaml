        title: Connect with your buddy
        points: 10
        description: |
          Youll have received an email about this. As soon as you can, schedule in a meet-up or skype call with this person. They’ll find out more about why you’ve joined, who you’d like to be connected to and show you around our online spaces (and our co-working space if you’re based in Wellington).
          Things to discuss:
          - What attracted you to Enspiral?
          - What is your intention coming in? What would success look like to you?
          - What do you think you might like to contribute? What skills are you bringing?
          Based on these questions, they will think of three people for you to connect with (either through Slack or email)

    title: Get the lay of the land
    description: |
      Some of the best reading and viewing material to get a sense of what Enspiral is all about and what we’ve been working on the past few years. We don’t suggest you consume all of these in your first week (unless you’re really keen!). The ones with an asterisk* on them are the most important reads to get you started.
